#' Example data for matched case-control analysis
#'
#' A subset of data from Jick *et al*. (1973) with data on a matched
#' case-control study on myocardial infarction and drinking 6+ cups of coffee
#' per day. Cases and controls were matched after excluding people who drank
#' 1 to 5 cups of coffee per day.
#'
#' @format ## `mccxmpl`
#' A data frame with 27 rows and 2 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`case`}{Integer variable of either `1` (exposed) or `0`
#'     (not exposed)}
#'   \item{`control`}{Integer variable of either `1` (exposed) or `0`
#'     (not exposed)}
#' }
#' @source In Stata 18 - run the commands:
#' ```
#' webuse mccxmpl, clear
#' expand pop
#' keep case control
#' ```
